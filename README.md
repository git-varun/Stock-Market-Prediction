# Stock Market Prediction

Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction repository. This project uses machine learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to predict stock market prices.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical stock price data. We use an LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited to time series data like stock prices.

The project includes a Jupyter notebook (`Main.ipynb`) that contains the main code for the project. This includes data loading, data preprocessing, model creation, model training, and prediction steps.

## Key Components

- **Main.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the main code for the project. It includes the steps for loading and preprocessing the data, creating and training the LSTM model, and making predictions.

- **TATASTEEL.NS .csv**: This CSV file contains historical stock price data for TATASTEEL.NS, which is used as input data for the LSTM model.

- **STOCK_PREDICTION.log**: This log file contains logs generated during the execution of the code, such as information about the training process or any errors or warnings that occurred.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required Python packages. You can then run the `Main.ipynb` notebook to train the model and make predictions.

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and the model's predictions should not be used for actual trading decisions without further testing and validation.
